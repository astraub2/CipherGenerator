# CipherGenerator
My boss at an escape room often uses word cyphers for his puzzles, I am  going to make him a desktop app to make custom cyphers and also display mirror images of input text.  Iâ€™m going to program it in C++ using the SFML library.  I estimate this project will take about 5-10 hours to complete, wether or not I complete it by the  end of the term depends on my workload. I want to have at least a graphical format done,  with an input box and generate button. Whether output works is a stretch goal that I will complete  over winter break.  Team Members: Amber Straub
